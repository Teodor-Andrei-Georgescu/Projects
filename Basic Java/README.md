This folder will contain different Java coding projects completed as part of an introductory coding class.

Each assignment has multiple files, most of which are helpers with one main file. There is also always a tester file included for each to check code functionality.

**The main file of each assignment will be stated in its README.md file**.

Please note that the higher the number, the more complex the project. Also, these projects contain multiple functions, all of which are well documented within the file. Each set of labs and assignments focuses on learning a different concept.
