This folder is going to hold different basic Python programs completed for an introductory coding class. All of these projects have extensive comments written within them explaining what each function does and how to execute it.

Please note that all the **main files** are the **"assignment #"** and **"lab #"** files. The lab files are generally more simple than the assignment files. The other files within this folder are either helper files or used as input for certain functions.

As the number increases on the main files, the more complex the functions. However, overall, this is still basic.
