This project is used to control the LED display on the Arduino ATMega2560.

Specifically, each letter of the alphabet has a different encoding, which results in a different LED light-up pattern representing it. Building upon that, this project can light up whole sentences, one letter at a time.
Furthermore, the LEDs can display for longer or shorter periods, depending on what is desired.

Please read the PDF for all the exact specifications and details.
