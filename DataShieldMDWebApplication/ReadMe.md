# **DataShieldMD**

## **Overview**
This project is a web-based application designed to help users securely process and anonymize datasets using advanced anonymization techniques such as **K-Anonymity**, **L-Diversity**, and **T-Closeness**. Users can upload datasets, apply anonymization algorithms, and manage processed files. The platform ensures data security and user-friendly interactions.

---

## **Features**
- **User Management**:
  - Registration, login, and logout functionality.
  - Authentication to ensure data security.

- **File Management**:
  - Upload `.csv` and `.xlsx` files (with automatic `.xlsx` to `.csv` conversion).
  - Search, filter, and paginate uploaded files.
  - Delete unwanted files.

- **Anonymization Algorithms**:
  - Support for **K-Anonymity**, **L-Diversity**, and **T-Closeness**.
  - Validate and apply algorithms based on user-provided parameters.
  - Save and manage algorithm configurations.

- **Processed Datasets**:
  - Download or delete processed datasets.
  - Search, filter, and paginate processed files.

- **Informational Pages**:
  - Home page with general information.
  - "How We Do It" page explaining the anonymization process.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, and CSS
- **Database**: SQLite (default, can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Additional Libraries**: Can be found in requirements.txt file.

## **Set up and deployment**

### **Option 1: Docker deployment**
The easiest way to access this application is to run it using docker. I have already created a Docker image for this application and posted it on my Dockerhub.
This image along with instructions can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/r/teodorandreigeorgescu/datashieldmd](here).

### **Option 2: Local Django deployment**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

#### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **4. Enter DataShieldMD subdirectory**
```bash
#If you do pwd you should be in a directory like this:
#/path/to/your/project/DataShieldMDWebApplication/DataShieldMD/
```

#### **5. Start server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

#### **6. Access the Application**
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## **Usage Instructions**

### **1. User Registration and Login**
- Navigate to the **Register** page to create an account.
- Use your credentials to log in.

### **2. Upload a File**
- Navigate to the **Upload Files** page.
- Upload `.csv` or `.xlsx` files. Files are saved securely in your account's directory.
- Use the **search** bar to find files by name or date.

### **3. Apply Anonymization Algorithms**
- Navigate to the **Algorithm Selection** page.
- Select a file and specify the sensitive fields.
- Choose one or more anonymization algorithms and configure their parameters.
  - **K-Anonymity**: Specify a `K` value (minimum 2).
  - **L-Diversity**: Specify `K` and `L` values (both minimum 2).
  - **T-Closeness**: Specify `K` (minimum 2) and `T` (0–1) values.
- Submit the form to anonymize your dataset. The processed file will appear in the **Processed Datasets** page.

### **4. Download or Delete Processed Files**
- Navigate to the **Processed Datasets** page.
- Use the **Download** button to download anonymized files.
- Use the **Delete** button to remove processed files.
