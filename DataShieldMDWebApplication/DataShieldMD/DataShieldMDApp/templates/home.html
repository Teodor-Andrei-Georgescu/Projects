        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Within the Medical industry, data privacy and security are of utmost importance since it involves sensitive information. However, the analysis of this data is critical to provide insights that can be transformed into actionable measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, before analysis can be performed, these datasets must be secured. This can be done by applying several different algorithms to the data that will ensure privacy. The algorithms make it difficult for anyone to deduce what information is linked to whom, thus upholding patient privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data Shield MD allows registered users to upload their datasets and apply different algorithms to secure data privacy. After the provided dataset has been processed, users can see some basic analytics to compare the results of different algorithms. Finally, users can then choose to download the processed dataset and forward it to their analysts.
