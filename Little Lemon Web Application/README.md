THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS.

This the final capstone project of the Coursera Meta Back-end Developer Professional Certificate that I took in my free time.

The cerficate had numerous courses but the biggest takeways were:
    -Learning about REST API's
    -Web application Architecture 
    -Basic HTML and CSS and some JavaScript
    -Using Python's Django framework for web application development

As I work through the project I will update more about the websites functionality and potentially remotely host it.
However, I know it will be a Web Application for a restuarant called Little Lemmon.


Please note the virtual environment 'venv' is included.
