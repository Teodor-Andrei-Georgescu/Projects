This project covered reading file images and performing certain Linux operations on those image files. These operations and their project files are **stat (stat360fs.c)**, **cat (cat360fs.c)**, and **ls (ls360fs.c)**. The **disk.c** is simply a struct used in the three main files, and the **functions_and_utilites.txt** just contains notes about some commands seen in the three main files.

For all the exact details and specifics, please read the PDF.

As for running the commands: **./<ls, stat 360fs.c> --image images/<file.img>**
and **./cat360fs.c --image images/<file.img> --file <file.txt**
