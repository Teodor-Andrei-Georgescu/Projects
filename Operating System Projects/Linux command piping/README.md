This folder contains three different files.

One is the PDF containing all the exact details and specifications of the projects. Please give it a read if you want more in-depth information about the projects.

There is a getstats.c file. This file contains the code for a project, which will print out different stats in a Linux operating system.
    - If it is run as "./getstats" with no arguments, then it will print general information about the operating system.
    - Otherwise, if it is run as "./getstats #," where # is a number, then information about the process corresponding to that number will be printed. All this is given, and the number corresponds to an existing process.

There will also be a gopipe.c file. This is a project that imitates the Linux piping feature.
The project can pipe up to four commands, assuming they are not entered incorrectly and their inputs and outputs are pipable into one another. For other restrictions, please check the bullet points on the last page of the PDF.
The project can be run:
  ./getstats (enter)
  (command 1 and arguements) (enter)
  (command 2 and arguements) (enter)
  (command 3 and arguements) (enter)
  (command 4 and arguements) (enter)
